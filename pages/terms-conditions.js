                                <ol>
                                    <li>In consideration of us providing Online Course Access, you must pay our charges <strong>(Charges)</strong> in accordance with this clause 4. Unless otherwise agreed, we will take your first payment upon acceptance of your Order. Payment may be made by following the prompts on the Site upon placing the Order  or  otherwise upon provision of a tax invoice by email (as applicable).</li>
                                    <li>The Charges are the prices quoted by us at the time you submit your Order.</li>
                                    <li>Our Charges are exclusive of goods and services tax <strong>(GST)</strong>. Where GST is payable in respect of some or all of the Online Course Access, you must pay us such additional amounts in respect of GST, at the applicable rate, at the same time as you pay the Charges.</li>
                                    <li>Unless otherwise agreed, payment for the Online Course Access is in advance. To the extent permitted by law, all Charges are non-refundable and non-cancellable other than if you validly terminate this Contract because of our breach.</li>
                                    <li>If we agree that you can pay the Charges other than by way of payment in advance, you must pay any Charges within 14 days of the date of our corresponding invoice.</li>
                                    <li>You can pay for the Online Course Access using a debit card or credit card or bank transfer. If you provide credit card information to us, you authorise us to charge that credit card for all Charges and an amount to cover any fees we incur in connection with charging that credit card. We will send you an electronic invoice following payment. For any failed or cancelled payments, a $20 administration fee may be charged.</li>
                                    <li>If you fail to make a payment under the Contract by the due date, then, without limiting our other remedies, you will have to pay interest on the amount unpaid at the rate set out under the Penalty Interest Rates Act 1983 plus 2%. Interest accrues on a day-to-day basis from the due date up to and including the date of actual payment..  NB: This clause will likely be deemed to be a &apos;penalty&apos; and not enforceable.</li>
                                    <li>Unless otherwise agreed, the Charges are payable in Australian Dollars.</li>
                                    <li>You acknowledge and agree that we can pursue payment collection through formal debt collection third parties if:
                                        <br />(a) any amount owing by you under this Contract is 14 or more days overdue; or
                                        <br />(b) you have made no effort to resolve a payment dispute.
                                        <br />All fees and costs incurred in securing these payments will be added to the total payable amount at the time of collection including third-party collection fees and interest.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Unless we agree otherwise, if you add a new feature or extend your Online Course Access  (or similar), you will be invoiced for the corresponding amount for the remainder of the corresponding  Subscription Period or  Period (as applicable) regardless of how long remains in that period. Unless otherwise agreed, there is no pro-rata treatment of such Charges.</li>
                                    <li>At least 90 days prior to the start of any  Subscription Renewal Period, we may submit revised Subscription pricing that will apply during that Subscription Renewal Period.</li>
                                    <li>You may have the option to purchase credits <strong>(Credits)</strong> for use on the Site. Credits are available for 12 months from the date of purchase, after which they expire. Unused Credits do not rollover into the next 12-month period.</li>
                                    <li>For the avoidance of doubt, the Online Courses  will be deemed to have been purchased by you at the time at which you have complied with all relevant Site procedures to enable a key code to be issued to you for the Online Courses  selected.</li>
